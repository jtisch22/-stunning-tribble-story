Once there was a man named Bill. Bill was a simple man that lived in a simple
town called Unalaska, which is in Alaska. 
For those of you who don't know, Alaska is very cold. Every day to go to work
bill has to walk through 5 feet of snow in sub-zero degree weather. To combat
this, Bill decided to buy a very thick jacket and a brand new pair of snow
shoes. This helps to make sure that he gets to work every day on time and also
allows for him to not sink into the snow whenever he walks.
However, since he lives in Unalaska, he has a dilema. Unalaska is in Alaska, but
is the oppsoite of everything else in Alaska-- so it is very hot. So, when at
home he has to wear summer clothes, and then packs winter clothes with him to 
work everyday when  he leaves Unalaska. He also changes the tires on his car to
winter tires whenever he leaves Unalaska  which is not ideal.
