Once there was a man named Bill. Bill was a simple man that lived in a simple
town called Unalaska, which is in Alaska. 
For those of you who don't know, Alaska is very cold. Every day to go to work
bill has to walk through 5 feet of snow in sub-zero degree weather. To combat
this, Bill decided to buy a very thick jacket and a brand new pair of snow
shoes. This helps to make sure that he gets to work every day on time and also
allows for him to not sink into the snow whenever he walks.
