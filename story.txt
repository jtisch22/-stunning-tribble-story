Once there was a man named Bill. Bill was a simple man that lived in a simple
town called Unalaska, which is in Alaska. 
For those of you who don't know, Alaska is very cold. Every day to go to work
Bill has to walk through 5 feet of snow in sub-zero degree weather. To combat
this, Bill decided to buy a very thick jacket and a brand new pair of snow
shoes. This helps to make sure that he gets to work every day on time and also
allows for him to not sink into the snow whenever he walks.
However, since he lives in Unalaska, he has a dilema. Unalaska is in Alaska, but
is the oppsoite of everything else in Alaska-- so it is very hot. So, when at
home he has to wear summer clothes, and then packs winter clothes with him to 
work everyday when  he leaves Unalaska. He also changes the tires on his car to
winter tires whenever he leaves Unalaska which is not ideal.
On his trek to work, the weather changes very rapidly. The temperature can go
from 80 degrees to -10 degrees in a matter of seconds. The situation gets even 
worse-the location where the weather changes is different every day. Bill has
to be ready to change from summer clothes to winter clothes in a matter of
seconds before he gets frostbite. Bill has gotten tired of this way of life
and has been debating if he should move out of Unalaska.
One day Bill decided that he had had enough with Unalaska. He pack up all of 
his things and moved to Wisconsin. In Wisconsin the weather is still cold and
hot, but Bill would only have to worry about changing from winter to summer 
clothes when the seasons changed from winter to summer. Bill enjoyed living in 
Wisconsin much more. He lived a long and happy life there.
